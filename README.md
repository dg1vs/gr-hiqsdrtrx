# gr-hiqsdrtrx
Gnu-radio  block for the HiQSDR transceiver

This software is based on the work from Stefan DL2STG. I only copied the blocks to the new gnuradio version.

The OOT gr-hiqsdr is a extension to make HiQSDR usable with GNU Radio. 
After installing you will find two new modules: HiQSDR sink and HiQSDR source.
HiQSDR source is the module to make the HiQSDR receiver usable in GNU Radio. 
All controls are included in this module, also the controls for the transmitter.
